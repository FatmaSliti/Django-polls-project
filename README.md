🐍 Django Beginner Project  ( First Step )
This project marks the beginning of my journey with Django.
I built it by following the official [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/), where I learned the foundations of backend development using Python.

Instead of just completing the steps, I took the time to understand what was happening behind the scenes — the views, URLs, templates, models, and how they all connect.
